Real-time video augmentation with ArUco markers. Markers with ids 1 and 2 will be augmented with the colors
blue and green respectively when either one or both of them are placed in the same frame. If a marker with
id three is also present in the frame it will be augmented with the combination of green and blue: green-blue.
